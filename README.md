Design Pattern Workshop
=======================

Clone the repository and run `composer install` and `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.  Once you are satisfied everything is
working, pair off with another developer and do the individual exercises in the `patterns/` folder.  Each one comes
with a `README.md` file explaining what needs to be done.  The exercise will involve implementing something previously
tagged with a `@todo` annotation, and removing a `markTestSkipped()` call from a PHPUnit test.
