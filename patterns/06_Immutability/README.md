Immutability
------------------

Immutable objects are objects whose state cannot be changed after instantiation.  This means that, after the object has
been created, it is impossible for it to get into an invalid state - there is nothing client code can do to it to break
it.

Implement the last method in the Money class to add the domain concept of VAT to our Value Object, without compromising
its immutibility.  Your solution should pass the unit tests provided.
