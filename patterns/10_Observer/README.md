Observer Pattern
----------------

The Observer Pattern allows a subject to notify its observers, usually of a change in its state.  The observers usually
implement a `notify()` method to receive notifications from the subject.

Implement the `Tweeter` subject to properly register and notify its observers.  Make sure the PHPUnit integration test
provided starts passing.
