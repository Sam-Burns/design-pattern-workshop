Facade Pattern
--------------

The Facade Pattern allows a number of objects to be grouped together as properties of a single Facade object.  The
Facade delegates calls to its public methods to the appropriate property.  This abstraction can allow the user to reduce
the number of constructor arguments of a class in client code, by grouping similar parameters together behind a single
Facade.

Implement the `MathsFacade` class to make the PHPUnit integration tests provided pass.
